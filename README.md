# 🎤 Composable AI Mock Interviewer

## 🚀 Live Demo  
👉 https://composable-ai-mock-interviewer-pi.vercel.app/

An AI-powered mock interview platform that simulates **real interviews** (HR / Tech / Behavioral) with **adaptive questioning**, **live evaluation**, **audio mode**, and a **final performance report** — built for rapid MVP demos and hackathons.

This project enables a candidate to:

1. Choose interview type & role  
2. Provide skills or resume context  
3. Answer adaptive questions  
4. Get instant scores + coaching tips  
5. Receive a final structured interview report  

Designed with a **Composable Blocks** mindset where each stage (Question, Memory, Evaluation, Feedback, Report) is modular and reusable.
